# Snake Boss v6.6 (Redirect fix)

- Redirect to **mobile.html** only if BOTH: small screen (<900px shortest side) **and** touch.
- Desktop devices (incl. MacBook Air with `maxTouchPoints>0`) stay on **index.html**.
- Includes v6.5 power-ups: Apple (+1), Chili (speed), Ice (slow boss), Star (x2 score).
- Dopamine background, event pulse, PWA cache bump (`sb-v6-6`).
