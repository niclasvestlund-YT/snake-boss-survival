# Snake Boss v6.8 — Dash & Combo

- Boss dash bursts every 3–6s (canceled by ICE).
- Difficulty ramps with score (up to ~35% faster).
- Apple **combo**: eat apples within 3s to build COMBO xN (max x5). Apple score = 1 + (combo-1).
- Tuning: faster base speed, slightly more power-ups, star rarer.
- Juicy feedback kept from v6.7 (particles, pulses, taunts).
- Centered grid with proper wrap. PWA cache `sb-v6-8`.
